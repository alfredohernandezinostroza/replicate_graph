A special emphasis is given to imaging work describing the neural substrate mediating motor sequence learning and motor adaptation paradigms. These results are then put into a plausible neurobiological model of motor skill learning, which proposes an integrated view of the brain plasticity mediating this form of memory at different stages of the acquisition process.

The authors review recent work from their laboratory designed to further understand the neurocognitive mechanisms of skill acquisition. The authors have demonstrated an important role for spatial working memory in 2 different types of motor skill learning, sensorimotor adaptation and motor sequence learning. They have shown that individual differences in spatial working memory capacity predict the rate of motor learning for sensorimotor adaptation and motor sequence learning, and have also reported neural overlap between a spatial working memory task and the early, but not late, stages of adaptation, particularly in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. The authors propose that spatial working memory is relied on for processing motor error information to update motor control for subsequent actions. Further, they suggest that working memory is relied on during learning new action sequences for chunking individual action elements together.									156	1	0	0	86	0	180	9	120	0022-2895	1940-1027														2012-01-01	WOS:000312451200006	23237467

Performance benefits have been observed following sleep in older adults for declarative learning tasks, but this benefit may be reduced for non-declarative, motor skill learning tasks. To date, studies of sleep-dependent consolidation of motor learning in older adults are limited to motor sequence tasks. To examine whether reduced sleep-dependent consolidation in older adults is generalizable to other forms of motor skill learning, we examined performance changes over intervals of sleep and wake in young (n = 62) and older adults (n = 61) using a mirror-tracing task, which assesses visuo-motor adaptation learning. Participants learned the task either in the morning or in evening, and performance was assessed following a 12-h interval containing overnight sleep or daytime wake. Contrary to our prediction, both young adults and older adults exhibited sleep-dependent gains in visuo-motor adaptation. There was a correlation between performance improvement over sleep and percent of the night in non-REM stage 2 sleep. These results indicate that motor skill consolidation remains intact with increasing age although this relationship may be limited to specific forms of motor skill learning.									14	0	0	0	12	0	16	0	25	0014-4819	1432-1106														2016-02-01	WOS:000369012600024	26563162

This perspective has led to the development of sophisticated models designed to elucidate the mechanisms of implicit sensorimotor learning. In this review, we argue for a broader perspective, emphasizing the contribution of explicit strategies to sensorimotor learning tasks. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework for motor learning that consists of three fundamental processes: reasoning, the process of understanding action-outcome relationships; refinement, the process of optimizing sensorimotor and cognitive parameters to achieve motor goals; and retrieval, the process of inferring the context and recalling a control policy. We anticipate that this '3R' framework for understanding how complex movements are learned will open exciting avenues for future research at the intersection between cognition and action.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4	17	25	2050-084X															2024-08-10	WOS:001283077700001	39087986

This review attempts to critically evaluate neuropsychological studies based on standardized testing of patients with selective cerebellar dysfunction. Findings are considered which address possible cerebellar influence on motor adaptation and habituation, motor skill acquisition, classical conditioning of motor responses, temporal processing, general intellectual abilities, frontal lobe functions, visuospatial abilities, memory and non-motor skill learning, and language. Deficits in motor learning and temporal processing are consistently observed in patients with cerebellar syndromes, while deficits in frontal lobe functions, visuospatial processing, memory, non-motor skill learning and language dysfunction have been reported in several studies, but have not been replicated in others. Methodological factors which may account for such discrepancies are discussed.									11	0	0	0	2	0	12	0	2	0954-0261	1369-1627														2001-11-01	WOS:000172071000005

Although it is well known that pain changes the way we move, it's impact on motor learning is less clear. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence on the impact of experimental and clinical pain on task performance and activity-dependent plasticity measures across learning and explore these findings in relation to different pain and motor learning paradigms. Five databases were searched: Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. Two reviewers independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane ROB2 and ROBIN-I. The overall strength of evidence was rated using the GRADE guidelines. Due to the heterogeneity of study methodologies a narrative synthesis was employed. Twenty studies were included in the review: fifteen experimental pain and five clinical pain studies, covering multiple motor paradigms. GRADE scores for all outcome measures suggested limited confidence in the reported effect for experimental pain and clinical pain, on motor learning. There was no impact of pain on any of the task performance measures following acquisition except for 'accuracy' during a tongue protrusion visuomotor task and 'timing of errors' during a motor adaptation locomotion task. Task performance measures at retention, and activity dependent measures at both acquisition and retention showed conflicting results. This review delivers a detailed synthesis of research studies exploring the impact of pain on motor learning. This is despite the challenges provided by the heterogeneity of motor learning paradigms, outcome measures and pain paradigms employed in these studies. The results highlight important questions for further research with the goal of strengthening the confidence of findings in this area.									4	0	0	0	0	0	5	1	2	1932-6203															2023-04-22	WOS:000933376800030	36099284

Evidence in support of a recent model proposed by Doyon and Ungerleider [Functional Anatomy of Motor Skill Learning. In: Squire LR, Schacter DL, editors. Neuropsychology of Memory. New York: Guilford Press, 2002.] is also discussed. The latter suggests that experience-dependent changes in the brain depend not only on the stage of learning, but also on whether subjects are required to learn a new sequence of movements (motor sequence learning) or learn to adapt to environmental perturbations (motor adaptation). This model proposes that the cortico-striatal and cortico-cerebellar systems contribute differentially to motor sequence learning and motor adaptation, respectively, and that this is most apparent during the slow learning phase (i.e. automatization) when subjects achieve asymptotic performance, as well as during reactivation of the new skilled behavior in the retention phase.

Acute cardiorespiratory exercise has emerged as a potential intervention to improve motor learning, however research in healthy older adults is limited. The current study investigated the impact of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIT) on a subsequent sequential motor learning task. Twenty-four older adults (aged 55-75 years) completed either 20-minutes of cycling, or an equivalent period of active rest before practicing a sequential force grip task. Skill learning was assessed during acquisition and at a 6-hour retention test. In contrast to expectation, exercise was associated with reduced accuracy during skill acquisition compared to rest, particularly for the oldest participants. However, improvements in motor skill were retained in the exercise condition, while a reduction in skill was observed following rest. Our findings indicate that high-intensity exercise conducted immediately prior to learning a novel motor skill may have a negative impact on motor performance during learning in older adults. We also demonstrated that exercise may facilitate early offline consolidation of a motor skill within this population, which has implications for motor rehabilitation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2	7	15		2056-7936														2024-02-29	WOS:001163777100001	38368455

Here we present an experimental model of this early learning process, in which targets are acquired by exploration and reinforcement rather than sensory error. We use this model to investigate the relative contribution of motor and sensory factors to human motor learning. Participants make active reaching movements or matched passive movements to an unseen target using a robot arm. We find that learning through passive movements paired with reinforcement is comparable with learning associated with active movement, both in terms of magnitude and durability, with improvements due to training still observable at a 1 week retest. Motor learning is also accompanied by changes in somatosensory perceptual acuity. No stable changes in motor performance are observed for participants that train, actively or passively, in the absence of reinforcement, or for participants who are given explicit information about target position in the absence of somatosensory experience. These findings indicate that the somatosensory system dominates learning in the early stages of motor skill acquisition.									68	0	0	0	38	0	75	6	32	0270-6474															2015-12-30	WOS:000366052700019	26490869
