Does Knowledge of Results Affect Motor Skill Learning and Adaptation in Interception-Like Tasks?	ClÃ¡udio Manoel Ferreira Leite,Herbert  Ugrinowitsch,Crislaine Rangel  Couto	2024/04//	10.1123/jmld.2022-0070	MOTOR learning, LARGE-scale brain networks, interceptive action, sensorimotor motor adaptation, unpredictable perturbations	Knowledge of results (KR), particularly its informational role, has often been regarded as redundant for learning interception-like tasks, such as coincidenceâ€“anticipation timing tasks. However, it is possible that the KR's guiding effect might be detrimental to motor adaptation, instead of only redundant, leading to a dependency on KR and steering the sensorimotor system away from relevant information of the task. In this study, we aimed to investigate KR's effect on learning a coincidenceâ€“anticipation timing tasks and on the adaptation to unpredictable perturbations. Two groups of participants practiced a coincidenceâ€“anticipation timing tasks with or without KR on 1 day and underwent testing the next day for learning (Retention test) and for adaptation to unpredictable perturbations (Exposure phase). Both groups exhibited similar learning results but failed to adapt to the perturbations, contradicting the assumption of negative guidance effects of KR and the positive effects of relying solely on intrinsic information (no KR). These findings suggest that motor adaptation may require specific information during the acquisition process, highlighting for more systematic analyses to understand this phenomenon better. Such insights could have practical implications in contexts like sports and rehabilitation, by providing learners with appropriate information for acquiring adaptive internal representations of tasks.

Implicit sensorimotor learning in ballistic movement for transporting an object to a target.	Naoyoshi Matsuda,Masaki O.  Abe	2024/09/09/	10.1038/s41598-024-71925-y	IMPLICIT learning, MOTOR learning, BALLISTIC conduction, GOAL (Psychology), JOYSTICKS, Implicit learning, Motor control, Motor learning	To enhance and sustain movement accuracy, humans make corrections in subsequent trials based on previous errors. Trial-by-trial learning occurs unconsciously and has mostly been studied using reaching movements. Goal-directed projection movements, such as archery, have an inherent delay between releasing an object and observing an outcome (e.g. the arrival position of the object), and this delay may prevent trial-by-trial implicit learning. We aimed to investigate the learning in the projection movement and the impacts of the inherent delay. During the experiment, a joystick was flicked once to transport a cursor from the starting location to a target. To manipulate the length of the delay between the cursor release and outcome observation, the speed of the cursor movement was varied: a fast speed can lead to a short delay. We found trial-by-trial implicit learning under all speed conditions, and the error sensitivity was not significantly different across speed conditions. Furthermore, the error sensitivity depended on the target location, that is, the movement direction. The results indicate that trial-by-trial implicit learning occurred in goal-directed projection movement, despite the length of the inherent delay. Additionally, the degree of this learning was affected by the movement direction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]	Scientific Reports		EBSCO
Exploring motor skill acquisition in bimanual coordination: insights from navigating a novel maze task.	Miguel Cienfuegos,Jonathan  Maycock,Abdeldjallil  Naceri,Tobias  DÃ¼sterhus,Risto  KÃµiva,Thomas  Schack,Helge  Ritter	2024/08/15/	10.1038/s41598-024-69200-1	MOTOR learning, MOTOR ability, MAZE tests, MAZE puzzles, CENTRAL nervous system, Bimanual coordination, Kinematic dynamics, Maze, Motor learning, Tactile feedback	In this study, we introduce a novel maze task designed to investigate naturalistic motor learning in bimanual coordination. We developed and validated an extended set of movement primitives tailored to capture the full spectrum of scenarios encountered in a maze game. Over a 3-day training period, we evaluated participants' performance using these primitives and a custom-developed software, enabling precise quantification of performance. Our methodology integrated the primitives with in-depth kinematic analyses and thorough thumb pressure assessments, charting the trajectory of participants' progression from novice to proficient stages. Results demonstrated consistent improvement in maze performance and significant adaptive changes in joint behaviors and strategic recalibrations in thumb pressure distribution. These findings highlight the central nervous system's adaptability in orchestrating sophisticated motor strategies and the crucial role of tactile feedback in precision tasks. The maze platform and setup emerge as a valuable foundation for future experiments, providing a tool for the exploration of motor learning and coordination dynamics. This research underscores the complexity of bimanual motor learning in naturalistic environments, enhancing our understanding of skill acquisition and task efficiency while emphasizing the necessity for further exploration and deeper investigation into these adaptive mechanisms.

Rest the brain to learn new gait patterns after stroke.	Chandramouli Krishnan,Thomas E.  Augenstein,Edward S.  Claflin,Courtney R.  Hemsley,Edward P.  Washabaugh,Rajiv  Ranganathan	2024/10/29/	10.1186/s12984-024-01494-8	MOTOR learning, STROKE patients, STROKE, MOTOR ability, ONLINE education, KNEE, Consolidation, Error-based learning, Hemiparesis, Motor task, Skill acquisition	Background: The ability to relearn a lost skill is critical to motor recovery after a stroke. Previous studies indicate that stroke typically affects the processes underlying motor control and execution but not the learning of those skills. However, these studies could be confounded by the presence of significant motor impairments. Furthermore, prior research involving the upper extremity indicates that stroke survivors have an advantage in offline motor learning when compared with controls. However, this has not been examined using motor acuity tasks (i.e., tasks focusing on the quality of executed actions) that have direct functional relevance to rehabilitation. Objective: Investigate how stroke affects leg motor skill learning during walking in stroke survivors. Methods: Twenty-five participants (10 stroke; 15 controls) were recruited for this prospective, case-control study. Participants learned a novel foot-trajectory tracking task on two consecutive days while walking on a treadmill. The task necessitated greater hip and knee flexion during the swing phase of the gait. Online learning was measured by comparing tracking error at the beginning and end of each practice session, offline (rest-driven) learning was measured by comparing the end of the first practice session to the beginning of the second, and retention was measured by comparing the beginning of the first practice session to the beginning of the second. Online learning, offline learning, and retention were compared between the stroke survivors and uninjured controls. Results: Stroke survivors improved their tracking performance on the first day (p = 0.033); however, the amount of learning in stroke survivors was lower in comparison with the control group on both days (p â‰¤ 0.05). Interestingly, stroke survivors showed higher offline learning gains when compared with uninjured controls (p = 0.011). Conclusions: Even stroke survivors with no perceivable motor impairments have difficulty acquiring new motor skills related to walking, which may be related to the underlying neural damage caused at the time of stroke. Furthermore, stroke survivors may require longer training with adequate rest to acquire new motor skills. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]	Journal of NeuroEngineering & Rehabilitation (JNER)		EBSCO
Distinct learning, retention, and generalization patterns in de novo learning versus motor adaptation.	Raphael Q. Gastrock,Bernard Marius  't Hart,Denise Y. P.  Henriques	2024/04/17/	10.1038/s41598-024-59445-1	MOTOR learning, MOTOR ability, GENERALIZATION, LEARNING, EXPLICIT instruction, MIRROR neurons	People correct for movement errors when acquiring new motor skills (de novo learning) or adapting well-known movements (motor adaptation). While de novo learning establishes new control policies, adaptation modifies existing ones, and previous work have distinguished behavioral and underlying brain mechanisms for each motor learning type. However, it is still unclear whether learning in each type interferes with the other. In study 1, we use a within-subjects design where participants train with both 30Â° visuomotor rotation and mirror reversal perturbations, to compare adaptation and de novo learning respectively. We find no perturbation order effects, and find no evidence for differences in learning rates and asymptotes for both perturbations. Explicit instructions also provide an advantage during early learning in both perturbations. However, mirror reversal learning shows larger inter-participant variability and slower movement initiation. Furthermore, we only observe reach aftereffects following rotation training. In study 2, we incorporate the mirror reversal in a browser-based task, to investigate under-studied de novo learning mechanisms like retention and generalization. Learning persists across three or more days, substantially transfers to the untrained hand, and to targets on both sides of the mirror axis. Our results extend insights for distinguishing motor skill acquisition from adapting well-known movements. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]	Scientific Reports		EBSCO
Changing Sleep Architecture through Motor Learning: Influences of a Trampoline Session on REM Sleep Parameters.	Daniel Erlacher,Daniel  Schmid,Stephan  Zahno,Michael  Schredl	2024/02//	10.3390/life14020203	MOTOR learning, RAPID eye movement sleep, SLEEP, TRAMPOLINES, PRACTICE (Sports), LONG-term memory, gross motor learning, motor memory consolidation, procedural memory, REM sleep, sleep architecture, trampoline	Previous research has shown that learning procedural tasks enhances REM sleep the following night. Here, we investigate whether complex motor learning affects sleep architecture. An experiment in which twenty-two subjects either learned a motor task (trampolining) or engaged in a control task (ergometer) was carried out in a balanced within-group design. After an initial laboratory adaptation night, two experimental nights were consecutive. The results indicate that learning a motor task had an effect on REM sleep parameters and, therefore, support the hypothesis that learning a procedural skill is related to an increase in REM sleep parameters. However, the statistical effect on REM sleep is smaller than found in previous studies. One might speculate that the motor learning was not intense enough compared to other studies. For sports practice, the results suggest that REM sleep, which is particularly rich in the morning, plays an important role in motor memory consolidation. Thus, this phase should not be interrupted after complex motor skill learning sessions. In future studies, other motor tasks should be applied. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]	Life (2075-1729)		EBSCO
Examination of acute spin exercise on GABA levels in aging and stroke: The EASE study protocol.	Keith M. McGregor,Thomas  Novak,Joe R.  Nocera,Kevin  Mammino,Steven L.  Wolf,Lisa C.  Krishnamurthy	2024/07/15/	10.1371/journal.pone.0297841	MOTOR learning, AEROBIC exercises, NUCLEAR magnetic resonance spectroscopy, EXERCISE physiology, SENSORIMOTOR cortex, MOTOR ability	Background: Changes in regional levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may indicate the potential for favorable responses to the treatment of stroke affecting the upper extremity. By selectively altering GABA levels during training, we may induce long-term potentiation and adjust excitatory/inhibitory balance (E/I balance). However, the impact of this alteration may be limited by neural damage or aging. Aerobic exercise has been shown to increase GABA levels in the sensorimotor cortex and improve motor learning by widening the dynamic range of E/I balance. The cross-sectional project, Effects of Acute Exercise on Functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Measures of GABA in Aging and Chronic Stroke (EASE), is designed to assess the functional relevance of changes in GABA concentration within the sensorimotor cortex before and after an acute aerobic exercise session. Methods/design: EASE will enroll 30 participants comprised of healthy younger adults (18â€“35 years; n = 10), older adults (60+ years; n = 10), and persons with chronic stroke (n = 10) affecting distal upper extremity function. We will use resting magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure all participants' GABA levels at rest before and after aerobic exercise. In addition, we will employ functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy using motor skill acquisition and recall tasks in healthy adults. We hypothesize that acute aerobic exercise will increase resting sensorimotor GABA concentration and that higher GABA resting levels will predict better motor learning performance on measures taken both inside and outside the magnet. We also hypothesize that a higher dynamic range of GABA during task-based spectroscopy in healthy adults will predict better motor skill acquisition and recall. Discussion: The EASE project will evaluate the effect of acute exercise on GABA levels as a biomarker of upper extremity motor skill learning with two populations (aging adults and those with chronic stroke). We predict that acute exercise, higher sensorimotor GABA levels, and broader dynamic range will be related to better motor skill acquisition. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]	PLoS ONE		EBSCO
Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on motor learning in healthy elderly individuals: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Fusheng Zhang,Yanbai  Han,Hongli  Wang,Yong  Li,Dingyu  Tang	2025/03//	10.1080/08990220.2024.2310851	TRANSCRANIAL direct current stimulation, MOTOR learning, OLDER people, MOTOR ability, MOTOR cortex, cerebellar, healthy elderly, motor learning, Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is widely used in motor recovery. Nevertheless, whether tDCS improves motor learning in healthy older adults is still controversial. This review aims to investigate the effectiveness of tDCS on motor learning in healthy elderly individuals. Methods: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase databases were initially searched from inception to December 5, 2022. The standard mean difference (SMD) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analysed via random-effect models. Results: Compared with the sham group, no significant effects were found regarding improvement in motor learning based on the speed or accuracy of the task and reaction time for the tDCS intervention group. After subgroup analysis, a significant effect was found for improved motor learning based on reaction time in the primary motor cortex (M1)-cerebellar group. Conclusions: This review revealed that tDCS had no significant effect on improving the speed or accuracy of motor learning in healthy elderly adults. However, it has a significant effect on improving the motor learning ability based on the reaction time of the task (mainly referring to the tDCS stimulation position of M1 and cerebellar), although the results have obvious heterogeneity and uncertainty.

Investigating the cortical effect of false positive feedback on motor learning in motor imagery based rehabilitative BCI training.	Hojun Jeong,Minsu  Song,Sung-Ho  Jang,Jonghyun  Kim	2025/03/18/	10.1186/s12984-025-01597-w	MOTOR learning, MOTOR imagery (Cognition), NEAR infrared spectroscopy, ROBOTIC exoskeletons, MEDICAL sciences, Brainâ€“computer interfaces, Event-related design, Feedback, Medical and Health Sciences Neurosciences, Motor imagery, Motor learning, Near-infrared spectroscopy	Background: Motor imagery-based brainâ€“computer interface (MI-BCI) is a promising solution for neurorehabilitation. Many studies proposed that reducing false positive (FP) feedback is crucial for inducing neural plasticity by BCI technology. However, the effect of FP feedback on cortical plasticity induction during MI-BCI training is yet to be investigated. Objective: This study aims to validate the hypothesis that FP feedback affects the cortical plasticity of the user's MI during MI-BCI training by first comparing two different asynchronous MI-BCI paradigms (with and without FP feedback), and then comparing its effectiveness with that of conventional motor learning methods (passive and active training). Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers and four patients with stroke participated in the study. We implemented two electroencephalogram-driven asynchronous MI-BCI systems with different feedback conditions. The feedback was provided by a hand exoskeleton robot performing hand open/close task. We assessed the hemodynamic responses in two different feedback conditions and compared them with two conventional motor learning methods using functional near-infrared spectroscopy with an event-related design. The cortical effects of FP feedback were analyzed in different paradigms, as well as in the same paradigm via statistical analysis. Results: The MI-BCI without FP feedback paradigm induced higher cortical activation in MI, focusing on the contralateral motor area, compared to the paradigm with FP feedback. Additionally, within the same paradigm providing FP feedback, the task period immediately following FP feedback elicited a lower hemodynamic response in the channel located over the contralateral motor area compared to the MI-BCI paradigm without FP feedback (p = 0.021 for healthy people; p = 0.079 for people with stroke). In contrast, task trials where there was no FP feedback just before showed a higher hemodynamic response, similar to the MI-BCI paradigm without FP feedback (p = 0.099 for healthy people, p = 0.084 for people with stroke). Conclusions: FP feedback reduced cortical activation for the users during MI-BCI training, suggesting a potential negative effect on cortical plasticity. Therefore, minimizing FP feedback may enhance the effectiveness of rehabilitative MI-BCI training by promoting stronger cortical activation and plasticity, particularly in the contralateral motor area.

Motor Learning in a Complex Motor Task Is Unaffected by Three Consecutive Days of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation.	Erik W. Wilkins,Milan  Pantovic,Kevin J.  Noorda,Mario I.  Premyanov,Rhett  Boss,Ryder  Davidson,Taylor A.  Hagans,Zachary A.  Riley,Brach  Poston	2024/08//	10.3390/bioengineering11080744	MOTOR cortex, MOTOR learning, TRANSCRANIAL alternating current stimulation, EVOKED potentials (Electrophysiology), TRANSCRANIAL magnetic stimulation, TRANSCRANIAL direct current stimulation, ACTION potentials, MOTOR ability, motor evoked potential, motor learning, motor skill, transcranial alternating current stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) delivered to the primary motor cortex (M1) can increase cortical excitability, entrain neuronal firing patterns, and increase motor skill acquisition in simple motor tasks. The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of tACS applied to M1 over three consecutive days of practice on the motor learning of a challenging overhand throwing task in young adults. The secondary aim was to examine the influence of tACS on M1 excitability. This study implemented a double-blind, randomized, SHAM-controlled, between-subjects experimental design. A total of 24 healthy young adults were divided into tACS and SHAM groups and performed three identical experimental sessions that comprised blocks of overhand throwing trials of the right dominant arm concurrent with application of tACS to the left M1. Performance in the overhand throwing task was quantified as the endpoint error. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were assessed in the right first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to quantify changes in M1 excitability. Endpoint error was significantly decreased in the post-tests compared with the pre-tests when averaged over the three days of practice (p = 0.046), but this decrease was not statistically significant between the tACS and SHAM groups (p = 0.474). MEP amplitudes increased from the pre-tests to the post-tests (p = 0.003), but these increases were also not different between groups (p = 0.409). Overall, the main findings indicated that tACS applied to M1 over multiple days does not enhance motor learning in a complex task to a greater degree than practice alone (SHAM).

ERP evidence of adaptive changes in error processing and attentional control during rhythm synchronization learning.	Gonçalo G. Padrão, Virginia V. Penhune, Ruth R. de Diego-Balaguer, Josep J. Marco-Pallares, Antoni A. Rodriguez-Fornells	2014-06-24 00:00:00	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.034		The ability to detect and use information from errors is essential during the acquisition of new skills. There is now a wealth of evidence about the brain mechanisms involved in error processing. However, the extent to which those mechanisms are engaged during the acquisition of new motor skills remains elusive. Here we examined rhythm synchronization learning across 12 blocks of practice in musically naïve individuals and tracked changes in ERP signals associated with error-monitoring and error-awareness across distinct learning stages. Synchronization performance improved with practice, and performance improvements were accompanied by dynamic changes in ERP components related to error-monitoring and error-awareness. Early in learning, when performance was poor and the internal representations of the rhythms were weaker we observed a larger error-related negativity (ERN) following errors compared to later learning. The larger ERN during early learning likely results from greater conflict between competing motor responses, leading to greater engagement of medial-frontal conflict monitoring processes and attentional control. Later in learning, when performance had improved, we observed a smaller ERN accompanied by an enhancement of a centroparietal positive component resembling the P3. This centroparietal positive component was predictive of participant's performance accuracy, suggesting a relation between error saliency, error awareness and the consolidation of internal templates of the practiced rhythms. Moreover, we showed that during rhythm learning errors led to larger auditory evoked responses related to attention orientation which were triggered automatically and which were independent of the learning stage. The present study provides crucial new information about how the electrophysiological signatures related to error-monitoring and error-awareness change during the acquisition of new skills, extending previous work on error processing and cognitive control mechanisms to a more ecologically valid context.

Action-induced changes in the perceived temporal features of visual events.	Inci I. Ayhan, Duygu D. Ozbagci	2020-07-06 00:00:00	10.1016/j.visres.2020.05.008		Perceived duration can be subject to deviations around the time of a voluntary action. Whether the mechanisms underlying action-induced visual duration effects are effector-specific or require a more generalized action-linked multimodal calibration with the transient visual system, however, is a question yet to be answered. Here, we investigate this using dynamic visual stimuli presented as contingent upon the execution of an arbitrarily associated voluntary manual response. Our results demonstrate that the duration of intervals with arbitrarily associated keypress-visual event pair is perceived as shorter than the duration in a pure visual condition, where the same stimuli are rather passively observed without the execution of a concurrent action. Whereas the control experiments show that motor memory and attention cannot explain the action-induced changes in perceived temporal features, action-induced changes in perceived speed are dissociated from those in perceived duration, and that the duration compression disappears using isoluminant or static stimuli, which together provide evidence that these two effects can be modulated in the motion-processing units, although via separate neural mechanisms.

Effects of a Tailored Pediatric Rehabilitation Protocol on Children With Neurometabolic Disorder: A Case Report.	Neha A NA. Brahmane, H V HV. Sharath, Nikita H NH. Seth, Arasha F AF. Khan	2024-04-29 00:00:00	10.7759/cureus.57115		Neurometabolic disorders encompass a diverse group of conditions characterized by inborn errors of metabolism, affecting various aspects of neurological function. This case report focuses on an 11-year-old male child with a neurometabolic disorder who presents with walking difficulties, speech impairment, and neurological symptoms. The background emphasizes the heterogeneity of neurometabolic disorders, their genetic and clinical complexity, and the need for tailored interventions to address specific manifestations. The primary aim of this study is to implement a comprehensive physiotherapy intervention plan for an 11-year-old male child with a neurometabolic disorder, targeting the improvement of gait abnormalities, regaining developmental milestones, and addressing associated challenges such as fatigue. The physiotherapy intervention plan employs a multifaceted approach, incorporating principles of neuroplasticity, motor learning, and adaptive strategies. A comprehensive gait training protocol involves proper orthotic fitting, forearm support walker training, treadmill exercises, and parallel bar training. Developmental milestones are addressed through motor and fine motor skill exercises. Coping strategies and energy conservation techniques are integrated to manage fatigue. The study utilizes outcome measures, including the Gross Motor Function Measure, Manual Ability Classification System, and Functional Independence Measure, to assess the impact of the intervention on the patient's functional abilities. Preliminary findings suggest promising improvements in gait, motor skills, and overall functional independence following the implemented physiotherapy intervention. The study underscores the potential effectiveness of a tailored approach rooted in neuroplasticity and motor learning principles for individuals with neurometabolic disorders. The patient-centered care model, encompassing coping strategies and energy conservation techniques, contributes to holistic well-being. While specific literature on these interventions in neurometabolic disorders is limited, the study provides valuable insights and calls for further research to refine and expand tailored therapeutic approaches in this challenging clinical context.

Educating Trainees to Treat Peripheral Arterial Disease: Challenges and Opportunities.	Anthony A. Campbell, Hossam H. Alslaim, Sira S. Duson, Vincent L VL. Rowe	2024-04-07 00:00:00	10.1016/j.avsg.2023.12.101		"Educating trainees to treat Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) carries specific contemporary challenges. The national increase of the prevalence of PAD combined with a significant shortage of vascular surgeons creates a need for concern for future management of this complex disease. Over the past 2 decades, traditional (5 + 2) and integrated (0 + 5) paradigms have fostered trainee annual growth and comparable case distribution and volumes in endovascular and open surgical treatment options have been maintained. Close evaluation into not only the absolute numbers of surgical cases, but the level of trainee involvement in each logged case is recommended. Future implementation of the Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) modules will hopefully assist in ensuring linear development of surgical skill and judgment. Additionally, advances in individual and systems level techniques to enhance skill acquisition in the form of ""off-the job training"" and simulation-based training may provide an enhancement to traditional technical training methods. Finally, the possibility and role of artificial intelligence in vascular surgery skill training must not be ignored, but carefully explored and utilized to modernize cognitive and technical skill preparation for trainees in the and delivery of care for PAD patients. Overall, the training residents for the treatment of PAD patients will be associated with new challenges that vascular surgery must embrace and surmount to advance our specialty."

[Update on latest European Cardiology Society (ESC) recommendations on sports cardiology].	M M. Deneye, A A. Ancion, P P. Lancellotti	2021-10-12 00:00:00			Regular physical activity is linked to a decrease in cardiovascular risk and mortality, whatever the cause. It is a very important part of the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, exercise can cause sudden death, especially when patients have underlying cardiomyopathy. The aim of the cardiologist will be to establish a benefit-risk balance between the risk of sudden death and the benefits of physical exercise. Sport cardiology is a relatively emerging field and the amount of proofs concerning cardiovascular diseases and sudden death is unfortunately weak. Most of the best practices are based on experts' consensus. But knowledge is improving in that domain and retrospectively we are able to do a better distinction between situations when a risk of sudden death is great versus other situations where a greater liberty of sport practice is authorized. This article aims to sort out new recommendations and their evolution during these last years.	Revue medicale de Liege	34632741.0	Pubmed
Long-term potentiation at cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses requires presynaptic and postsynaptic signaling cascades.	De-Juan DJ. Wang, Li-Da LD. Su, Ya-Nan YN. Wang, Dong D. Yang, Cheng-Long CL. Sun, Lin L. Zhou, Xin-Xin XX. Wang, Ying Y. Shen	2014-02-07 00:00:00	10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4064-13.2014		Long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) at cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synapses play critical roles in motor learning. The 1 Hz stimulation at PF-PC synapses induces a postsynaptically expressed LTP that requires a postsynaptic Ca(2+) transient, phosphatases, and nitric oxide (NO). However, the mechanism underlying 1 Hz PF-LTP remains unclear because none of the known events is related to each other. Here, we demonstrated that 1 Hz PF-LTP requires postsynaptic cytosolic phospholipase A2 α (cPLA2α)/arachidonic acid (AA) signaling and presynaptic endocannabinoid receptors. Using patch-clamp recording in cerebellar slices, we found that 1 Hz PF-LTP was abolished in cPLA2α-knock-out mice. This deficit was effectively rescued by the conjunction of 1 Hz PF stimulation and the local application of AA. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol and the retrograde activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) were also involved in 1 Hz LTP because it was blocked by the hydrolysis of 2-AG or by inhibiting CB1Rs. The amount of NO released was detected using an NO electrode in cultured granule cells and PF terminals. Our results showed that the activation of CB1Rs at PF terminals activated NO synthetase and promoted NO production. The 1 Hz PF-stimuli evoked limited NO, but 100 Hz PF stimulation generated a large amount. Therefore, 1 Hz PF-LTP, distinct from classical postsynaptically expressed plasticity, requires concurrent presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. In addition, NO of sufficient amplitude decides between the weakening and strengthening of PF-PC synapses.

Contributions of the basal ganglia and functionally related brain structures to motor learning	Julien Doyon,Pierre  Bellec,Rhonda  Amsel,Virginia  Penhune,Oury  Monchi,Julie  Carrier,Stephane  Lehericy,Habib  Benali	APR 12 2009	10.1016/j.bbr.2008.11.012		This review discusses the cerebral plasticity, and the role of the cortico-striatal system in particular, observed as one is learning or planning to execute a newly learned motor behavior up to when the skill is consolidated or has become highly automatized. A special emphasis is given to imaging work describing the neural substrate mediating motor sequence learning and motor adaptation paradigms. These results are then put into a plausible neurobiological model of motor skill learning, which proposes an integrated view of the brain plasticity mediating this form of memory at different stages of the acquisition process.

Neurocognitive Contributions to Motor Skill Learning: The Role of Working Memory	Rachael D. Seidler,Jin  Bo,Joaquin A.  Anguera	2012	10.1080/00222895.2012.672348		Researchers have begun to delineate the precise nature and neural correlates of the cognitive processes that contribute to motor skill learning. The authors review recent work from their laboratory designed to further understand the neurocognitive mechanisms of skill acquisition. The authors have demonstrated an important role for spatial working memory in 2 different types of motor skill learning, sensorimotor adaptation and motor sequence learning. They have shown that individual differences in spatial working memory capacity predict the rate of motor learning for sensorimotor adaptation and motor sequence learning, and have also reported neural overlap between a spatial working memory task and the early, but not late, stages of adaptation, particularly in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. The authors propose that spatial working memory is relied on for processing motor error information to update motor control for subsequent actions. Further, they suggest that working memory is relied on during learning new action sequences for chunking individual action elements together.	JOURNAL OF MOTOR BEHAVIOR		Web of Science
Sleep benefits consolidation of visuo-motor adaptation learning in older adults	Janna Mantua,Bengi  Baran,Rebecca M. C.  Spencer	FEB 2016	10.1007/s00221-015-4490-7		Sleep is beneficial for performance across a range of memory tasks in young adults, but whether memories are similarly consolidated in older adults is less clear. Performance benefits have been observed following sleep in older adults for declarative learning tasks, but this benefit may be reduced for non-declarative, motor skill learning tasks. To date, studies of sleep-dependent consolidation of motor learning in older adults are limited to motor sequence tasks. To examine whether reduced sleep-dependent consolidation in older adults is generalizable to other forms of motor skill learning, we examined performance changes over intervals of sleep and wake in young (n = 62) and older adults (n = 61) using a mirror-tracing task, which assesses visuo-motor adaptation learning. Participants learned the task either in the morning or in evening, and performance was assessed following a 12-h interval containing overnight sleep or daytime wake. Contrary to our prediction, both young adults and older adults exhibited sleep-dependent gains in visuo-motor adaptation. There was a correlation between performance improvement over sleep and percent of the night in non-REM stage 2 sleep. These results indicate that motor skill consolidation remains intact with increasing age although this relationship may be limited to specific forms of motor skill learning.

Fundamental processes in sensorimotor learning: Reasoning, refinement, and retrieval	Jonathan S. Tsay,Hyosub E.  Kim,Samuel D.  Mcdougle,Jordan A.  Taylor,Adrian  Haith,Guy  Avraham,John W.  Krakauer,Anne G. E.  Collins,Richard B.  Ivry	AUG 1 2024	10.7554/eLife.91839		Motor learning is often viewed as a unitary process that operates outside of conscious awareness. This perspective has led to the development of sophisticated models designed to elucidate the mechanisms of implicit sensorimotor learning. In this review, we argue for a broader perspective, emphasizing the contribution of explicit strategies to sensorimotor learning tasks. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework for motor learning that consists of three fundamental processes: reasoning, the process of understanding action-outcome relationships; refinement, the process of optimizing sensorimotor and cognitive parameters to achieve motor goals; and retrieval, the process of inferring the context and recalling a control policy. We anticipate that this '3R' framework for understanding how complex movements are learned will open exciting avenues for future research at the intersection between cognition and action.

Neuropsychological deficits in cerebellar syndromes	I Daum,BE  Snitz,H  Ackermann	NOV 2001	10.1080/09540260120082119		Interest in the role of the cerebellum in cognitive functioning has been increasing in recent years, based on both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence. This review attempts to critically evaluate neuropsychological studies based on standardized testing of patients with selective cerebellar dysfunction. Findings are considered which address possible cerebellar influence on motor adaptation and habituation, motor skill acquisition, classical conditioning of motor responses, temporal processing, general intellectual abilities, frontal lobe functions, visuospatial abilities, memory and non-motor skill learning, and language. Deficits in motor learning and temporal processing are consistently observed in patients with cerebellar syndromes, while deficits in frontal lobe functions, visuospatial processing, memory, non-motor skill learning and language dysfunction have been reported in several studies, but have not been replicated in others. Methodological factors which may account for such discrepancies are discussed.	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY		Web of Science
Exploring pain interference with motor skill learning in humans: A systematic review	David Matthews,Edith Elgueta  Cancino,Deborah  Falla,Ali  Khatibi	SEP 13 2022	10.1371/journal.pone.0274403		Motor learning underpins successful motor skill acquisition. Although it is well known that pain changes the way we move, it's impact on motor learning is less clear. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence on the impact of experimental and clinical pain on task performance and activity-dependent plasticity measures across learning and explore these findings in relation to different pain and motor learning paradigms. Five databases were searched: Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. Two reviewers independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane ROB2 and ROBIN-I. The overall strength of evidence was rated using the GRADE guidelines. Due to the heterogeneity of study methodologies a narrative synthesis was employed. Twenty studies were included in the review: fifteen experimental pain and five clinical pain studies, covering multiple motor paradigms. GRADE scores for all outcome measures suggested limited confidence in the reported effect for experimental pain and clinical pain, on motor learning. There was no impact of pain on any of the task performance measures following acquisition except for 'accuracy' during a tongue protrusion visuomotor task and 'timing of errors' during a motor adaptation locomotion task. Task performance measures at retention, and activity dependent measures at both acquisition and retention showed conflicting results. This review delivers a detailed synthesis of research studies exploring the impact of pain on motor learning. This is despite the challenges provided by the heterogeneity of motor learning paradigms, outcome measures and pain paradigms employed in these studies. The results highlight important questions for further research with the goal of strengthening the confidence of findings in this area.	PLOS ONE		Web of Science
Distinct contribution of the cortico-striatal and cortico-cerebellar systems to motor skill learning	J Doyon,V  Penhune,LG  Ungerleider	2003	10.1016/S0028-3932(02)00158-6		This review paper focuses on studies in healthy human subjects that examined the functional neuroanatomy and cerebral plasticity associated with the learning, consolidation and retention phases of motor skilled behaviors using modern brain imaging techniques. Evidence in support of a recent model proposed by Doyon and Ungerleider [Functional Anatomy of Motor Skill Learning. In: Squire LR, Schacter DL, editors. Neuropsychology of Memory. New York: Guilford Press, 2002.] is also discussed. The latter suggests that experience-dependent changes in the brain depend not only on the stage of learning, but also on whether subjects are required to learn a new sequence of movements (motor sequence learning) or learn to adapt to environmental perturbations (motor adaptation). This model proposes that the cortico-striatal and cortico-cerebellar systems contribute differentially to motor sequence learning and motor adaptation, respectively, and that this is most apparent during the slow learning phase (i.e. automatization) when subjects achieve asymptotic performance, as well as during reactivation of the new skilled behavior in the retention phase.

High-intensity acute exercise impacts motor learning in healthy older adults	Eleanor M. Taylor,Claire J.  Cadwallader,Dylan  Curtin,Trevor T. -J.  Chong,Joshua J.  Hendrikse,James P.  Coxon	FEB 17 2024	10.1038/s41539-024-00220-2		Healthy aging is associated with changes in motor sequence learning, with some studies indicating decline in motor skill learning in older age. Acute cardiorespiratory exercise has emerged as a potential intervention to improve motor learning, however research in healthy older adults is limited. The current study investigated the impact of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIT) on a subsequent sequential motor learning task. Twenty-four older adults (aged 55-75 years) completed either 20-minutes of cycling, or an equivalent period of active rest before practicing a sequential force grip task. Skill learning was assessed during acquisition and at a 6-hour retention test. In contrast to expectation, exercise was associated with reduced accuracy during skill acquisition compared to rest, particularly for the oldest participants. However, improvements in motor skill were retained in the exercise condition, while a reduction in skill was observed following rest. Our findings indicate that high-intensity exercise conducted immediately prior to learning a novel motor skill may have a negative impact on motor performance during learning in older adults. We also demonstrated that exercise may facilitate early offline consolidation of a motor skill within this population, which has implications for motor rehabilitation.

Somatosensory Contribution to the Initial Stages of Human Motor Learning	Nicolo F. Bernardi,Mohammad  Darainy,David J.  Ostry	OCT 21 2015	10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1344-15.2015		The early stages of motor skill acquisition are often marked by uncertainty about the sensory and motor goals of the task, as is the case in learning to speak or learning the feel of a good tennis serve. Here we present an experimental model of this early learning process, in which targets are acquired by exploration and reinforcement rather than sensory error. We use this model to investigate the relative contribution of motor and sensory factors to human motor learning. Participants make active reaching movements or matched passive movements to an unseen target using a robot arm. We find that learning through passive movements paired with reinforcement is comparable with learning associated with active movement, both in terms of magnitude and durability, with improvements due to training still observable at a 1 week retest. Motor learning is also accompanied by changes in somatosensory perceptual acuity. No stable changes in motor performance are observed for participants that train, actively or passively, in the absence of reinforcement, or for participants who are given explicit information about target position in the absence of somatosensory experience. These findings indicate that the somatosensory system dominates learning in the early stages of motor skill acquisition.	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE		Web of Science
