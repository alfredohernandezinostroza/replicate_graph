    "abstract": "The ability to detect and use information from errors is essential during the acquisition of new skills. There is now a wealth of evidence about the brain mechanisms involved in error processing. However, the extent to which those mechanisms are engaged during the acquisition of new motor skills remains elusive. Here we examined rhythm synchronization learning across 12 blocks of practice in musically na\u00efve individuals and tracked changes in ERP signals associated with error-monitoring and error-awareness across distinct learning stages. Synchronization performance improved with practice, and performance improvements were accompanied by dynamic changes in ERP components related to error-monitoring and error-awareness. Early in learning, when performance was poor and the internal representations of the rhythms were weaker we observed a larger error-related negativity (ERN) following errors compared to later learning. The larger ERN during early learning likely results from greater conflict between competing motor responses, leading to greater engagement of medial-frontal conflict monitoring processes and attentional control. Later in learning, when performance had improved, we observed a smaller ERN accompanied by an enhancement of a centroparietal positive component resembling the P3. This centroparietal positive component was predictive of participant's performance accuracy, suggesting a relation between error saliency, error awareness and the consolidation of internal templates of the practiced rhythms. Moreover, we showed that during rhythm learning errors led to larger auditory evoked responses related to attention orientation which were triggered automatically and which were independent of the learning stage. The present study provides crucial new information about how the electrophysiological signatures related to error-monitoring and error-awareness change during the acquisition of new skills, extending previous work on error processing and cognitive control mechanisms to a more ecologically valid context.",

    "abstract": "Perceived duration can be subject to deviations around the time of a voluntary action. Whether the mechanisms underlying action-induced visual duration effects are effector-specific or require a more generalized action-linked multimodal calibration with the transient visual system, however, is a question yet to be answered. Here, we investigate this using dynamic visual stimuli presented as contingent upon the execution of an arbitrarily associated voluntary manual response. Our results demonstrate that the duration of intervals with arbitrarily associated keypress-visual event pair is perceived as shorter than the duration in a pure visual condition, where the same stimuli are rather passively observed without the execution of a concurrent action. Whereas the control experiments show that motor memory and attention cannot explain the action-induced changes in perceived temporal features, action-induced changes in perceived speed are dissociated from those in perceived duration, and that the duration compression disappears using isoluminant or static stimuli, which together provide evidence that these two effects can be modulated in the motion-processing units, although via separate neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Neurometabolic disorders encompass a diverse group of conditions characterized by inborn errors of metabolism, affecting various aspects of neurological function. This case report focuses on an 11-year-old male child with a neurometabolic disorder who presents with walking difficulties, speech impairment, and neurological symptoms. The background emphasizes the heterogeneity of neurometabolic disorders, their genetic and clinical complexity, and the need for tailored interventions to address specific manifestations. The primary aim of this study is to implement a comprehensive physiotherapy intervention plan for an 11-year-old male child with a neurometabolic disorder, targeting the improvement of gait abnormalities, regaining developmental milestones, and addressing associated challenges such as fatigue. The physiotherapy intervention plan employs a multifaceted approach, incorporating principles of neuroplasticity, motor learning, and adaptive strategies. A comprehensive gait training protocol involves proper orthotic fitting, forearm support walker training, treadmill exercises, and parallel bar training. Developmental milestones are addressed through motor and fine motor skill exercises. Coping strategies and energy conservation techniques are integrated to manage fatigue. The study utilizes outcome measures, including the Gross Motor Function Measure, Manual Ability Classification System, and Functional Independence Measure, to assess the impact of the intervention on the patient's functional abilities. Preliminary findings suggest promising improvements in gait, motor skills, and overall functional independence following the implemented physiotherapy intervention. The study underscores the potential effectiveness of a tailored approach rooted in neuroplasticity and motor learning principles for individuals with neurometabolic disorders. The patient-centered care model, encompassing coping strategies and energy conservation techniques, contributes to holistic well-being. While specific literature on these interventions in neurometabolic disorders is limited, the study provides valuable insights and calls for further research to refine and expand tailored therapeutic approaches in this challenging clinical context.",

    "abstract": "Educating trainees to treat Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) carries specific contemporary challenges. The national increase of the prevalence of PAD combined with a significant shortage of vascular surgeons creates a need for concern for future management of this complex disease. Over the past 2 decades, traditional (5 + 2) and integrated (0 + 5) paradigms have fostered trainee annual growth and comparable case distribution and volumes in endovascular and open surgical treatment options have been maintained. Close evaluation into not only the absolute numbers of surgical cases, but the level of trainee involvement in each logged case is recommended. Future implementation of the Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) modules will hopefully assist in ensuring linear development of surgical skill and judgment. Additionally, advances in individual and systems level techniques to enhance skill acquisition in the form of \"off-the job training\" and simulation-based training may provide an enhancement to traditional technical training methods. Finally, the possibility and role of artificial intelligence in vascular surgery skill training must not be ignored, but carefully explored and utilized to modernize cognitive and technical skill preparation for trainees in the and delivery of care for PAD patients. Overall, the training residents for the treatment of PAD patients will be associated with new challenges that vascular surgery must embrace and surmount to advance our specialty.",

    "abstract": "Regular physical activity is linked to a decrease in cardiovascular risk and mortality, whatever the cause. It is a very important part of the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, exercise can cause sudden death, especially when patients have underlying cardiomyopathy. The aim of the cardiologist will be to establish a benefit-risk balance between the risk of sudden death and the benefits of physical exercise. Sport cardiology is a relatively emerging field and the amount of proofs concerning cardiovascular diseases and sudden death is unfortunately weak. Most of the best practices are based on experts' consensus. But knowledge is improving in that domain and retrospectively we are able to do a better distinction between situations when a risk of sudden death is great versus other situations where a greater liberty of sport practice is authorized. This article aims to sort out new recommendations and their evolution during these last years.",

    "abstract": "Lisberger and Sejnowski (1992) recently proposed a computational model for motor learning in the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) system. They showed that the steady-state gain of the system can be modified by changing the ratio of the two time constants along the feedforward and the feedback projections to the Purkinje cell unit in their model VOR network. Here we generalize their model by including two additional time constant variables and two synaptic weight variables, which were set to fixed values in their original model. We derive the stability conditions of the generalized system and thoroughly analyze its steady-state and transient behavior. It is found that the generalized system can display a continuum of behavior with the Lisberger-Sejnowski model and a static model proposed by Miles et al. (1980b) as special cases. Moreover, although mathematically the Lisberger-Sejnowski model requires two precise relationships among its parameters, the model is robust against small perturbations from the physiological point of view. Additional considerations on the gain of smooth pursuit eye movement, which is believed to share the positive feedback loop with the VOR network, suggest that the VOR network should operate in the parameter range favoring the behavior studied by Lisberger and Sejnowski. Under this condition, the steady-state gain of the VOR is found to depend on all four time constants in the network. The time constant of the Purkinje cell unit should be relatively small in order to achieve effective VOR learning through the modifications of the other time constants. Our analysis provides a thorough characterization of the system and could thus be useful for guiding further physiological tests of the model.",

    "abstract": "Long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) at cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synapses play critical roles in motor learning. The 1 Hz stimulation at PF-PC synapses induces a postsynaptically expressed LTP that requires a postsynaptic Ca(2+) transient, phosphatases, and nitric oxide (NO). However, the mechanism underlying 1 Hz PF-LTP remains unclear because none of the known events is related to each other. Here, we demonstrated that 1 Hz PF-LTP requires postsynaptic cytosolic phospholipase A2 \u03b1 (cPLA2\u03b1)/arachidonic acid (AA) signaling and presynaptic endocannabinoid receptors. Using patch-clamp recording in cerebellar slices, we found that 1 Hz PF-LTP was abolished in cPLA2\u03b1-knock-out mice. This deficit was effectively rescued by the conjunction of 1 Hz PF stimulation and the local application of AA. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol and the retrograde activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) were also involved in 1 Hz LTP because it was blocked by the hydrolysis of 2-AG or by inhibiting CB1Rs. The amount of NO released was detected using an NO electrode in cultured granule cells and PF terminals. Our results showed that the activation of CB1Rs at PF terminals activated NO synthetase and promoted NO production. The 1 Hz PF-stimuli evoked limited NO, but 100 Hz PF stimulation generated a large amount. Therefore, 1 Hz PF-LTP, distinct from classical postsynaptically expressed plasticity, requires concurrent presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. In addition, NO of sufficient amplitude decides between the weakening and strengthening of PF-PC synapses.",
